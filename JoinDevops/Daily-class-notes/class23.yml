what is interpolcation ?
- It is to connect text and variables
-  It is a powerful feature in terraform that allows you to dynamically insert values into strings, enabling you to create flexible and reusable configurations. This is achieved by using ${...} syntax to reference variables, expressions, and functions within strings.
or

- the process of evaluating a string literal containing one or more placeholders, yielding a result in which the placeholders are replaced with their corresponding values.

- Interpolation syntax allows you to reference variables, attributes of resources, call functions etc.

Interpolation usecases: 
 > Building dynamic resouce names and tags
 > Constructing complex configuration blocks based on variables
 > Generating dynamic file paths and URls
 > creating conditional statements and loops within strings
 > Referencing other resources and their attributes.


what is locals ?
- locals and variables are same, refering key-value pairs
- locals can hold expressions and use it wherever you want. you can use variables inside locals but you cannot use variables/locals inside variables.

datasources:
-------------
- If terraform queries some data from the aws like aws_iam then it is called datasource
