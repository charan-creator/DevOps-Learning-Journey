# 1. write a shell script that reads a text file and counts the occurences of each word, displaying the top 5 most frequent words along with their counts.

# 2. Develop a backup script that takes a source directory and a destination directory as input and creates a compressed archive (.tar.gz) of the source directory in the destination folder with a timestamp.

# 3. Display the top 5 cpu consuming process in linux, send alert if reaches more than threshold

```
#!/bin/bash

echo "Script to display top 5 cpu consuming process in linux and sending alert if it reaches more than threshold.

#adding colors

R="\e[31m"
G="\e[32m"
N=""\e[0m""

MAX_CPU_USAGE=10
CPU_USAGE=$(top -bn1 | grep load | awk '{printf "%.0f\n", $(NF-2)}')

#This script calculates the current CPU usage by combining the top, grep, and awk commands.

#Here's how it works:

# top -bn1: This command runs the top utility once (-n1) and displays the output in a batch mode (-b).
# grep load: This filters the output of top to only show the line containing the "load average" information.
# awk '{printf "%.0f\n", $(NF-2)}': This extracts the second-to-last field (NF-2) from the filtered line and prints it as a # #rounded integer. This field represents the overall CPU usage percentage.

while:
do 
  sleep 5
  echo $CPU_USAGE

  if [ "$CPU_USAGE" -ge "$MAX_CPU_USAGE" ]
  then
   echo -e "$R CPU USAGE IS HIGH $N"

# 4. Convert Rows into Columns and Columns into Rows.

Example :

- if file.txt has the following content

 name age
 alice 21
 ryan 30

 output the following :

 name alice ryan
 age 21 30


5. write a script to calculate the sum of numbers in an input array
6. write a script that takes a filename as input and counts the number of lines, words, and characters in file
7. write a script that searches a directory for files with a specific extension and moves them to a new directory
8. write a script that takes a directory as input and compresses all the files in the directory into a single archive file
9. write a script that generates random password of a specified length
