what is bare repository in git and what is the purpose of it and how to create it ?
 > A bare repository in Git is a special type of repository that lacks a working directory. This means it only contains the Git history and metadata, but not the actual project files.
> Bare repositories are primarily used for sharing code between developers. They act as central servers where developers can push and pull changes. They are not intended for local development as they lack the working files needed for editing
> You can create a bare repository using the git init --bare command. This will create a new directory containing only the Git data

Git rebase vs reset vs revert 
  - Git rebase is simmilar to git merge but there is a difference. The end goal of both git rebase and git merge is to keep all the commits in a single line. But, rebase will delete
  - git merge is straightforward and non-destructive, but it can clutter the history. Git rebase provides a cleaner history but requires caution. Choose based on your teamâ€™s preferences and project need
  - git revert to safely undo changes in a public context, and reserve git reset for local adjustments on private branches
