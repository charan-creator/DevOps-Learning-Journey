installing build tools
-----------------------
As a jenkins user, we have to create job to automate your apps workflow

we are going to see example for two apps i.e; one on java app and two on javascript app
- Java with maven build tool
- Run tests
- Build jar file

and for javascript app
- node app
- Run tests
- package and push to repo

maven and npm needs to be available on jenkins

Depending upon your app(programming language) you need to have different tools installed and configured on jenkins
