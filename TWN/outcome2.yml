- Inefficient process

- overtime new requirements may arise

- many places of failure and miscommunication

- huge preparation

- no fast feedback

Benefits of Agile :

- speed of development, testing and development cycles

- immediate feedback

- fast development and deployment process

- scrum and kanaban - specific implementation
