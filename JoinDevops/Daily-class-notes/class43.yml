Jenkins - Introduction
-----------------------

Jenkins server installation using official docs

trigger job, pre-build, build, post build

freestyle disadvantages :
----------------------------
1. anyone can login and do the changes, difficult to track what went

2. difficult to restore

3. I can't see the history, no versions

scripted way :
----------------

1. Review can be done before do something

2. Easy to restore

3. Track the changes

4. Maintain history

jenkins pipeline :
-------------------

```jenkinsfile
pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
       stage("hello") {
          steps {
              echo "hello, world"
          }
       }
    }
}

```

Name should be jenkinsfile

jenkins is a master node

install agents and distribute the pipeline to the agents

jenkins follows master node architecture

1. when work is there master calls agent and ask them to do work
2. daily agent comes to master to check any work

To setup nodes, we have to go to the master node of jenkins and then `dashboard >> Manage jenkins >> Nodes` 

cd /var/lib/jenkins --> home folder of jenkins

how to configure github to jenkins webhook ?

 system-1 something happened, we need to inform system-2

 when events happens, those can be notified.

 when developer pushed code to github, we need to trigger the pipeline
