- code is hosted centrally on the internet is called `code repository`
- Every developer will have the entire copy of the code locally
- code is fetched from the remote repo and pushed to code repo
- Git know how to merge changes automatically
- Merge conflicts --> when same line was changed
        - git can't able to fix it automatically. Have to be done manually

- Best practice : push and pull often from remote repo
- Every code change and file is tracked.
- you can revert commits
- Each change is labelled with commit messages

Basic concepts of Git :

- Remote Repository: where code lives 
- Local Repository:  local copy of code
- History : history of code changes (git log)
- staging : changes to commit
- Git clients: To execute git commands

Git Workflow :
---------------
Working Directory ------> Staging area -------------> Local Repository ------> Remote Repository
